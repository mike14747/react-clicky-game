## About the code in this project:

This project use 5 components which are pieced together in **App.js** (which is the only file using **State**), then are rendered through **index.js** to the root id element in **public/index.html**... the main (and only) page.
<br />

The 5 components are:
* header.js
* counter.js
* instructions.js
* pic.js
* footer.js
<br />

Each of the components reside in the **components** folder. Three of the components (header, instructions and pic) have their own subfolders within the components folder because they also have associated css files and/or images they need to be grouped with.
